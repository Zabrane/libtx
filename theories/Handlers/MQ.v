(** * Distributed message queue

    This IO handler implements a generic "message queue" service
    similar to Apache Kafka. Every published message gets an integer
    offset, and can later be fetched using the offset as a key.

     nondeterministic, with the following possible outcomes:
     - message gets successfully produced, and its offset is
       returned to the caller as [Some Offset]
     - message gets lost in transition, [None] is returned to the
       caller
     - message gets successfully produced, but the response gets
       lost in transition. The caller gets [None] *)
